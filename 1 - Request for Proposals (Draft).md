and must respond to all applicable sections, or respond why a section is 
not applicable. A failure to demonstrate how the solution being proposed 
addresses the Technical Requirements outlined may result in the proposal

questionable or objectionable material. Comments concerning defects and
objectionable material must be made in writing and received by the

## SECTION 2. SCOPE OF WORK & DELIVERABLES

### <a name="2.01"></a>SEC. 2.01 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 


Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 7 designates the Department of Health
and Social Services as having responsibility for administering the Food
Stamp, Adult Public Assistance, Medical Assistance, Heating Assistance,
Alaska Temporary Assistance and General Relief programs.

As a part of this designation, the DHSS Division of Public Assistance
(DPA) is charged with determining eligibility for each of the programs
based on State and Federal regulation. Supplemental Appropriations Act,
2008, Pub. L. No. 110-252; Section 1940 of the Social Security Act
requires states to have a system in place to verify the assets of aged,
blind, disabled or long- term care applicants as part of determining
eligibility for Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act further required the
system to be electronic.

Furthermore, Alaska Statutes (AS) 47.05.105 requires DPA to establish an
enhanced computerized income, asset, and identity verification system
for the purposes of verifying eligibility, eliminating duplication of
public assistance payments, and deterring waste and fraud in public
assistance programs administered by the department.

Furthermore, 7 CFR 272.16 requires DPA to establish a computer matching
agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS)
National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to verify applicant employment
data for the determination of SNAP eligibility and correct benefit
amount.

In the performance of the above, this solicitation requests proposals
from qualified vendors to assess the available third party systems that
would enable the department to comply with the electronic asset
verification system for aged, blind, disabled, and long-term care
applicants and the electronic income, asset, NDNH and identity
verification for all applicants/recipients. DHSS seeks to enter into
contract with an experienced vendor to support the functions of the
verification systems, as detailed in the Deliverables (Section 2.04) of
this solicitation. The offeror must be able to demonstrate effective
systems that verify accounts at financial institutions, real estate
holdings, income, and identity. The successful vendor will be
responsible for providing a web user interface or standalone portal.

### <a name="2.02"></a>SEC. 2.02 CONTRACT TERM & WORK SCHEDULE

The term of this contract will be from July 1, 2020 -- June 30, 2021,
plus four (4) annual renewal options, each to be exercised at the sole
discretion of the State.

### <a name="2.03"></a>SEC. 2.03 SCOPE OF WORK 


The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is soliciting
proposals from qualified vendors to provide a web based subscription
service to meet the requirements established by the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) for an electronic asset verification system,
requirements established in AS 47.05.105 for an electronic income, asset
and identity verification system and 7 CFR 272.16 for checks against the
National Directory of New Hires.

DHSS expects the initial check for asset verification to include
approximately 19,000 recipients. Matches for the enhanced verification
system will include approximately 250,000 recipients, which will include
approximately 85,000 individuals that will need to be matched to the
National Directory of New Hires. For checks done through the web portal
for new applications and renewals, we expect approximately 2,000 monthly
for asset verification and 20,000 for the enhanced verification system.

### <a name="2.04"></a>SEC. 2.04 DELIVERABLES

**Project Management Plan**

The selected vendor will be required to submit a project management plan
that addresses the implementation and onboarding of the solution. This
plan at a minimum must include:

-   Implementation schedule to include major milestones and tracking
    methodologies

-   Staffing plan

-   Change plan

-   Risk and Issue management

-   Roll out plan for staff usage of the solution

-   Training plan

-   Communication and escalation plan

**Initial Applicant and Recipient Data Matching**

Initially, the state agency will provide the contractor with an initial
file containing the names, dates-of-birth, addresses, Social Security
numbers of all active applicants and recipients. The file will include
pending applications and recipients. The file will include the number of
individuals in the household, types of assistance received and the total
household gross income reported to make the eligibility decision. The
contractor shall query records against data sources available to the
contractor (excluding any fee-per- transaction services) for the
following data elements: physical address; earned income; unearned
income; citizenship/lawful permanent residence status; liquid assets and
financial accounts; real and personal property; incarceration status;
lottery winnings; death information and any other information from
eligibility verification sources. The contractor will then return a list
of cases that have matches based on the above based criteria so that
DHSS can input the data on the cases as necessary.

After the initial scan of beneficiaries the state will use a web based
portal to check the same set of information for new applicants and
renewals.

DHSS intends to check the web based portal at the date of new
applications and renewals for existing recipients. DHSS may desire to
run matches where a list of clients is supplied to the vendor and
matching information is returned, but those will be determined at a
later date. The initial request will be for a large match done for
existing clients followed by use of the web portal to check new
applicants and when existing clients are required to renew their cases.

**Annual Report**

The vendor will assist DHSS in producing an annual report for DHSS
leadership, the Governor's office, and the legislature which contains
the number of individuals found ineligible for assistance based on the
initial scan and ongoing queries.

In addition to the annual report production, the vendor will need to be
able to produce Ad-Hoc reports which include a summary of the requests,
and the results returned.

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content

An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as \"an actual or
prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected
substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation,
the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract.\"

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation,
the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at
least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the
award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed
award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the
procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent
to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient
standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must
include the following information:

-   the name, address, and telephone number of the protester;

-   the signature of the protester or the protester\'s representative;

-   identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or
    contract at issue;

-   a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest
    including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief
    requested.

Protests filed by telex or telegram are not acceptable because they do
not contain a signature. Fax copies containing a signature are
acceptable.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer\'s decision and
contain the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 \"Legal and Contractual Remedies."

### <a name="6.11"></a>SEC. 6.11 APPLICATION OF PREFERENCES

Alaska Preferences are not available for this solicitation, per federal
funding regulations, which do not allow local preferences.

### <a name="6.12"></a>SEC. 6.12 FORMULA USED TO CONVERT COST TO POINTS

The distribution of points based on cost will be determined as set out
in 2 AAC 12.260(c). The lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on
the other proposals will be determined using the formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)\]*

### <a name="6.13"></a>SEC. 6.13 EXAMPLES: CONVERTING COST TO POINTS

Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points

Step 1

List all proposal prices, adjusted where appropriate by the application
of applicable preferences.

Offeror \#1 \$40,000\
Offeror \#2 \$42,750\
Offeror \#3 \$47,500

Step 2

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 100 points to
cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of
points.

Offeror \#1 receives 40 points.

The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost
proposal, in this case \$40,000,\
receives the maximum number of points allocated to cost = 40 points.

Offeror \#2 receives 37.4 points.

\$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
\$42,750 cost of proposal = 37.4

Offeror \#3 receives 33.7 points.

\$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
\$47,500 cost of proposal = 33.7

substantial terms, conditions, and performance requirements of the RFP.

Offerors may not qualify the proposal nor restrict the rights of the
state. If an offeror does so, the procurement officer may determine the
proposal to be a non-responsive counter-offer and the proposal may be
rejected.

Minor informalities may be waived by the procurement officer. These may
include informalities that:

-   do not affect responsiveness;

-   are merely a matter of form or format;

-   do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other
    offers;

-   do not change the meaning or scope of the RFP;

-   are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature;

-   do not reflect a material change in the work; or

-   do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or
    provision.

The state reserves the right to refrain from making an award if it
determines that to be in its best interest.

A proposal from a debarred or suspended offeror shall be rejected.

### <a name="8.01"></a>SEC. 8.01 ATTACHMENT 1 -- COST PROPOSAL

Note: The purpose of the cost proposal is to provide a mechanism for
offerors to submit their estimated level of effort and hourly rates so
that DHSS can evaluate and score and then use to establish billing rates
for the resultant contract. While total project cost is non-negotiable,
DHSS may choose to reallocate the project funds based on the ongoing
project needs.

Please provide your estimated cost for completion of all project roles
and all related expenses required to fulfill the project requirements
using the following format:

Role (please provide a separate line for every role required for project
completion)

Hourly Rate Estimated Hours for Project Completion Total Cost for Role

Materials, Travel, and all other non-personnel project costs (please
itemize into categories)

TOTAL PROJECT BUDGET (not to exceed \$xxx)

\*\* Note that the estimated level of effort and roles must align with
the Staffing Plan included in your technical proposal

The procurement officer will guide you to ensuring the cost proposal
will be presented in an 'apples to apples' format -- so that the
expectation of the cost will be equitable. No portion of the cost
proposal can be subject to interpretation (apples to oranges).

-   What format will this take? -- the cost proposal will guide the way
    pricing is presented, and ultimately, the way billing will occur in
    the contract. Any necessary reporting requirements may need to be
    met here.

-   How does the division wish to pay for these services in the
    resultant contract? Some examples include:

    -   Flat rate monthly (or quarterly, etc)

    -   Fee for service

    -   Fixed price

    -   Per completed deliverable, etc.

-   Travel will need to included and quantified here -- including number
    of trips and individuals necessary

-   Any other expenses will need to be identified, and who's
    responsibility it will be to pay for them.
