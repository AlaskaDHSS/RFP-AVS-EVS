    experience offering web based subscription services in
    asset/enhanced verification systems approved by the Centers for

questionable or objectionable material. Comments concerning defects and
objectionable material must be made in writing and received by the

## SECTION 2. SCOPE OF WORK & DELIVERABLES

### <a name="2.01"></a>SEC. 2.01 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 


Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 7 designates the Department of Health and Social Services as having responsibility for administering the Food Stamp, Adult Public Assistance, Medical Assistance, Heating Assistance, Alaska Temporary Assistance and General Relief programs.

As a part of this designation, the DHSS Division of Public Assistance (DPA) is charged with determining eligibility for each of the programs based on State and Federal regulation. Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-252; Section 1940 of the Social Security Act requires states to have a system in place to verify the assets of aged, blind, disabled or long- term care applicants as part of determining eligibility for Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act further required the system to be electronic.

Furthermore, Alaska Statutes (AS) 47.05.105 requires DPA to establish an enhanced computerized income, asset, and identity verification system for the purposes of verifying eligibility, eliminating duplication of public assistance payments, and deterring waste and fraud in public assistance programs administered by the department.

Furthermore, 7 CFR 272.16 requires DPA to establish a computer matching agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to verify applicant employment data for the determination of SNAP eligibility and correct benefit amount. 

In the performance of the above, this solicitation requests proposals from qualified vendors to assess the available third party systems that would enable the department to comply with the electronic asset verification system for aged, blind, disabled, and long-term care applicants and the electronic income, asset, NDNH and identity verification for all applicants/recipients. DHSS seeks to enter into contract with an experienced vendor to support the functions of the verification systems, as detailed in the Deliverables (Section 2.04) of this solicitation. The offeror must be able to demonstrate effective systems that verify accounts at financial institutions, real estate holdings, income, and identity. The successful vendor will be responsible for providing a web user interface or standalone portal.


### <a name="2.02"></a>SEC. 2.02 CONTRACT TERM & WORK SCHEDULE

The term of this contract will be from an anticipated start date of June 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021, plus four (4) annual renewal options, each to be exercised at the sole discretion of the State.

### <a name="2.03"></a>SEC. 2.03 SCOPE OF WORK 


The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is soliciting proposals from qualified vendors to provide a web based subscription service to meet the requirements established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for an electronic asset verification system, requirements established in AS 47.05.105 for an electronic income, asset and identity verification system and 7 CFR 272.16 for checks against the National Directory of New Hires.

DHSS expects the initial check for asset verification to include approximately 19,000 recipients. Matches for the enhanced verification system will include approximately 250,000 recipients, which will include approximately 85,000 individuals that will need to be matched to the National Directory of New Hires. For checks done through the web portal for new applications and renewals, we expect approximately 2,000 monthly for asset verification and 20,000 for the enhanced verification system. 


### <a name="2.04"></a>SEC. 2.04 DELIVERABLES

**Project Management Plan**

The selected vendor will be required to submit a project management plan
that addresses the implementation and onboarding of the solution. This
plan at a minimum must include:

-   Implementation schedule to include major milestones and tracking
    methodologies

-   Staffing plan

-   Change plan

-   Risk and Issue management

-   Roll out plan for staff usage of the solution

-   Training plan

-   Communication and escalation plan

**Initial Applicant and Recipient Data Matching**

Initially, the state agency will provide the contractor with an initial file containing the names, dates-of-birth, addresses, Social Security numbers of all active applicants and recipients. The file will include pending applications and recipients. The file will include the number of individuals in the household, types of assistance received and the total household gross income reported to make the eligibility decision. The contractor shall query records against data sources available to the contractor for the following data elements: physical address; earned income; unearned income; citizenship/lawful permanent residence status; liquid assets and financial accounts; real and personal property; incarceration status; lottery winnings; death information and any other information from eligibility verification sources. The contractor will then return a list of cases that have matches based on the above based criteria so that DHSS can input the data on the cases as necessary.

After the initial scan of beneficiaries the state will use a web based portal to check the same set of information for new applicants and renewals.

DHSS intends to check the web based portal at the date of new applications and renewals for existing recipients. DHSS may desire to run matches where a list of clients is supplied to the vendor and matching information is returned, but those will be determined at a later date. The initial request will be for a large match done for existing clients followed by use of the web portal to check new applicants and when existing clients are required to renew their cases.


**Annual Report**

The vendor will assist DHSS in producing an annual report for DHSS leadership, the Governor’s office, and the legislature which contains the number of individuals found ineligible for assistance based on the initial scan and ongoing queries. 

In addition to the annual report production, the vendor will need to be able to produce Ad-Hoc reports which include a summary of the requests, and the results returned. The number of Ad-Hoc reports required will fluctuate throughout the year, but are estimated to be requested 24 times annually.

### <a name="6.10"></a>SEC. 6.10 PROTEST

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content of the RFP.

An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as "an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation, the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract."

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation, the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient
standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must
include the following information:

-   the name, address, and telephone number of the protester;

-   the signature of the protester or the protester's representative;

-   identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or
    contract at issue;

-   a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest
    including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief
    requested.

Protests filed by telex or telegram are not acceptable because they do
not contain a signature. Fax copies containing a signature are
acceptable.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer's decision and
contain the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 "Legal and Contractual Remedies."

### <a name="6.11"></a>SEC. 6.11 APPLICATION OF PREFERENCES

Alaska Preferences are not available for this solicitation, per federal
funding regulations, which do not allow local preferences.

### <a name="6.12"></a>SEC. 6.12 FORMULA USED TO CONVERT COST TO POINTS

The distribution of points based on cost will be determined as set out
in 2 AAC 12.260(c). The lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on
the other proposals will be determined using the formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)\]*

### <a name="6.13"></a>SEC. 6.13 EXAMPLES: CONVERTING COST TO POINTS

Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points

Step 1

List all proposal prices, adjusted where appropriate by the application
of applicable preferences.

Offeror \#1 \$40,000\
Offeror \#2 \$42,750\
Offeror \#3 \$47,500

Step 2

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 100 points to
cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of
points.

Offeror \#1 receives 40 points.

The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost
proposal, in this case \$40,000,\
receives the maximum number of points allocated to cost = 40 points.

Offeror \#2 receives 37.4 points.

\$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
\$42,750 cost of proposal = 37.4

Offeror \#3 receives 33.7 points.

\$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
\$47,500 cost of proposal = 33.7

--------------------------------------------

The Implementation contractor must comply with the following
provisions:

1. Executive Order 11246, entitled "Equal Employment Opportunity," as
   amended by Executive Order 11375, and as supplemented by the
   Department of Labor Regulations (41 CFR Part 60): The Executive
   Order prohibits federal contractors and federally-assisted
   construction contractors and subcontractors who do over \$10,000
   in Government business in one year from discriminating in
   employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
   or national origin. The Executive Order also requires Government
   contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that equal
   opportunity is provided in all aspects of their employment.

2. **The Clean Air Act, Section 306:**
    No Federal agency may enter into any contract with any person who is
    convicted of any offense under section 113(c) for the procurement of
    goods, materials, and services to perform such contract at any
    facility at which the violation which gave rise to such conviction
    occurred if such facility is owned, leased, or supervised by such
    person. The prohibition in the preceding sentence shall continue until
    the Administrator certifies that the condition giving rise to such a
    conviction has been corrected. For convictions arising under section
    113(c)(2), the condition giving rise to the conviction also shall be
    considered to include any substantive violation of this Act associated
    with the violation of 113(c)(2). The Administrator may extend this
    prohibition to other facilities owned or operated by the convicted
    person.

a.  The Administrator shall establish procedures to provide all Federal
    agencies with the notification necessary for the purposes of
    subsection (a).

b.  In order to implement the purposes and policy of this Act to protect
    and enhance the quality of the Nation\'s air, the President shall,
    not more than 180 days after enactment of the Clean Air Amendments
    of 1970 cause to be issued an order (1) requiring each Federal
    agency authorized to enter into contracts and each Federal agency
    which is empowered to extend Federal assistance by way of grant,
    loan, or contract to effectuate the purpose and policy of this Act
    in such contracting or assistance activities, and (2) setting forth
    procedures, sanctions, penalties, and such other provisions, as the
    President determines necessary to carry out such requirement.

c.  The President may exempt any contract, loan, or grant from all or
    part of the provisions of this section where he determines such
    exemption is necessary in the paramount interest of the United
    States and he shall notify the Congress of such exemption.

d.  The President shall annually report to the Congress on measures
    taken toward implementing the purpose and intent of this section,
    including but not limited to the progress and problems associated
    with implementation of this section. \[42 U.S.C. 7606\]


3.  **The Clean Water Act:**

    a.  No Federal agency may enter into any contract with any person who
        has been convicted of any offense under Section 309(c) of this Act
    for the procurement of goods, materials, and services if such
    contract is to be performed at any facility at which the violation
    which gave rise to such conviction occurred, and if such facility is
    owned, leased, or supervised by such person. The prohibition in
    preceding sentence shall continue until the Administrator certifies
    that the condition giving rise to such conviction has been
    corrected.

b.  The Administrator shall establish procedures to provide all Federal
    agencies with the notification necessary for the purposes of
    subsection (a) of this section.

c.  In order to implement the purposes and policy of this Act to protect
    and enhance the quality of the Nation's water, the President shall,
    not more than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, cause to be
    issued an order:

   i.  requiring each Federal agency authorized to enter into contracts and
       each Federal agency which is empowered to extend Federal assistance
       by way of grant, loan, or contract to effectuate the purpose and
       policy of this Act in such contracting or assistance activities, and

   ii. setting forth procedures, sanctions, penalties, and such other
        provisions, as the President determines necessary to carry out such
        requirement.

d.  The President may exempt any contract, loan, or grant from all or
    part of the provisions of this section where he determines such
    exemption is necessary in the paramount interest of the United
    States and he shall notify the Congress of such exemption.

e.  The President shall annually report to the Congress on measures
    taken in compliance with the purpose and intent of this section,
    including, but not limited to, the progress and problems associated
    with such compliance.

f.  (1) No certification by a contractor, and no contract clause, may
        be required in the case of a contract for the acquisition of
        commercial items in order to implement a prohibition or requirement
        of this section or a prohibition or requirement issued in the
        implementation of this section.

   (2) In paragraph (1), the term "commercial item" has the meaning
       given such term in section 4(12) of the Office of Federal
       Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(12)).

4.  **The Anti-Lobbying Act**: This Act prohibits the recipients of
    federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds
    for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the federal
    government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan.
    As required by Section 1352, Title 31 of the U.S. Code and
    implemented at 34 CFR Part 82 for persons entering into a grant or
    cooperative agreement over \$100,000, as defined at 34 CFR Part
    82, Section 82.105 and 82.110, the applicant certifies that:

a.  No federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or
    on behalf of the undersigned, to any person for influencing or
    attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a
    member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an
    employee of a member of Congress in connection with the making of
    any federal grant, the entering into of any cooperative agreement,
    and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification
    of any federal grant or cooperative agreement;

b.  If any funds other than federal appropriated funds have been paid or
    will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to
    influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of
    Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a
    member of Confess in connection with this federal grantor o
    cooperative agreement, the undersigned shall complete and submit
    Standard Form -- LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying," in
    accordance with its instructions;

c.  The undersigned shall require that the language of this
    certification be include in the award documents for all sub-awards
    at all tiers (including sub-grants, contracts under grants and
    cooperative agreements, and subcontracts) and that all
    sub-recipients shall certify and disclose accordingly.

5.  **Americans with Disabilities Act**: This Act (28 CFR Part 35, Title
    II, Subtitle A) prohibits discrimination on the basis of
    disability in all services, programs, and activities provided to
    the public by State and local governments, except public
    transportation services.

6.  **Drug Free Workplace Statement**: The Federal government
    implemented the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 in an attempt to
    address the problems of drug abuse on the job. It is a fact that
    employees who use drugs have less productivity, a lower quality of
    work, and a higher absenteeism, and are more likely to
    misappropriate funds or services. From this perspective, the drug
    abuser may endanger other employees, the public at large, or
    themselves. Damage to property, whether owned by this entity or
    not, could result from drug abuse on the job. All these actions
    might undermine public confidence in the services this entity
    provides. Therefore, in order to remain a responsible source for
    government contracts, the following guidelines have been adopted:
    
a.  The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or
    use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the work place.

b.  Violators may be terminated or requested to seek counseling from an
    approved rehabilitation service.

c.  Employees must notify their employer of any conviction of a criminal
    drug statue no later than five days after such conviction.

d.  Although alcohol is not a controlled substance, it is nonetheless a
    drug. It is the policy of the Arkansas Department of Health WIC
    Program that abuse of this drug will also not be tolerated in the
    workplace.

e.  Contractors of federal agencies are required to certify that they
    will provide drug-free workplaces for their employees.

7.  **Debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters**: As
    required by Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, and
    implemented at 34 CFR Part 85, for prospective participants in
    primary covered transactions, as defined at 34 CFR Part 85,
    Sections 85.105 and 85.110.

a.  The applicant certifies that it and its principals:

   i.  Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,
        declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered
        transactions by any federal department or agency;

   ii. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application been
        convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for
        commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with
        obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal,
        state, or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction;
        violation of federal or state antitrust statutes or commission of
        embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction
        of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;

   iii. Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly
         charged by a governmental entity (federal, state, or local) with
         commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1)(b) of
         this certification; and

   iv. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application had
        one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local)
        terminated for cause or default.


b.  Where the applicant is unable to certify to any of the statements in
    this certification, he or she shall attach an explanation to this
    application.


8.  The federal government reserves a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and
    irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and
    to authorize others to use, for federal government purposes, the
    copyright in any work developed under a grant, sub-grant, or
    contract under a grant or sub-grant or any rights of copyright to
    which a contractor purchases ownership.

    of Federal assistance funds is providing the certification as set
    out below.

2.  The certification in this class is a material representation of fact
    upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was entered
    into. If it is later determined that the prospective recipient of
    Federal assistance funds knowingly rendered an erroneous
    certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
    Federal Government, the Department of Labor (DOL) may pursue
    available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

3.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds shall provide
    immediate written notice to the person to whom this Proposal is
    submitted if at any time the prospective recipient of Federal
    assistance funds learns that its certification was erroneous when
    submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed
    circumstances.

4.  The terms \"covered transaction,\" \"debarred,\" \"suspended,\"
    \"ineligible,\" \"lower tier covered transaction,\"
    \"participant,\" \"person,\" \"primary covered transaction,\"
    \"principal,\" \"Proposal,\" and \"voluntarily excluded,\" as used
    in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and
    Coverage sections of rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You
    may contact the person to which this Proposal is submitted for
    assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.

5.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds agrees by
    submitting this Proposal that, should the proposed covered
    transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any
    lower tier covered transaction with a person who is debarred,
    suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
    participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by
    the DOL.

6.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds further agrees
    by submitting this Proposal that it will include the clause titled
    \"Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
    Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions,\" without
    modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all
    solicitations for lower tier covered transactions.

7.  A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification
    of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction
    that it is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily
    excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the
    certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method
    and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its
    principals. Each participant may but is not required to check the
    List of Parties Excluded from Procurement or Non-procurement
    Programs.

8.  Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require
    establishment of a system of records in order to render in good
    faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and
    information of a participant is not required to exceed that which
    is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course
    of business dealings.

Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly
enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is
suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies
available to the Federal Government, the DOL may pursue available
remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

termination.

The contractor may not assign or delegate this contract, or any part
of it, or any right to any of the money to be paid under it, except

protected against the State's unencumbered use or distribution, the
contractor agrees that this paragraph supersedes any such statement
and renders it void. The contractor, for a period of three years after

Director. Unless otherwise directed by the Project Director, the
contractor may retain copies of all the materials.

terms of this contract supersede any provisions the contractor may
seek to add. The contractor may not add additional or different terms

acknowledges and agrees that, among other things, provisions in any
documents it seeks to append hereto that purport to (1) waive the
State of Alaska's sovereign immunity, (2) impose indemnification
obligations on the State of Alaska, or (3) limit liability of the

in its discretion deduct from the contract price or consideration the
full amount of the commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent
fee.

In the performance of this contract, the contractor must comply with
all applicable federal, state, and borough regulations, codes, and

bonds.

**Article 16. Force Majeure:**

The parties to this contract are not liable for the consequences of
any failure to perform, or default in performing, any of their
obligations under this Agreement, if that failure or default is caused
by any unforeseeable Force Majeure, beyond the control of, and without
the fault or negligence of, the respective party. For the purposes of
this Agreement, Force Majeure will mean war (whether declared or not);
revolution; invasion; insurrection; riot; civil commotion; sabotage;
military or usurped power; lightning; explosion; fire; storm; drought;

Indemnity and Insurance</strong>
</p>

**Article 1. Indemnification**

The Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for
error, omission or negligent act of the Contractor under this
agreement. The Contractor shall not be required to indemnify the
contracting agency for a claim of, or liability for, the independent
negligence of the contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or
liability for, the joint negligent error or omission of the Contractor
and the independent negligence of the Contracting agency, the
indemnification and hold harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a
comparative fault basis. "Contractor" and "Contracting agency", as
used within this and the following article, include the employees,
agents and other contractors who are directly responsible,
respectively, to each. The term "independent negligence" is negligence
other than in the Contracting agency's selection, administration,
monitoring, or controlling of the Contractor and in approving or
accepting the Contractor's work.

**Article 2. Insurance**

Without limiting contractor\'s indemnification, it is agreed that
contractor shall purchase at its own expense and maintain in force at
all times during the performance of services under this agreement the
following policies of insurance. Where specific limits are shown, it
is understood that they shall be the minimum acceptable limits. If the
contractor\'s policy contains higher limits, the state shall be
entitled to coverage to the extent of such higher limits. Certificates
of Insurance must be furnished to the contracting officer prior to
beginning work and must provide for a notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with
policy provisions. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of
insurance or lapse of the policy is a material breach of this contract
and shall be grounds for termination of the contractor's services.
All insurance policies shall comply with and be issued by insurers
licensed to transact the business of insurance under AS 21.

**2.1 Workers' Compensation Insurance:** The Contractor will provide
a letter stating that they work independently; therefore have no need to carry Workers Compensation coverage.

premises and operations used by the Contractor in the performance of services under this
agreement with minimum coverage limits
of $300,000 combined single limit per claim.

vehicles used by the Contractor in the performance of services under this agreement with minimum
coverage limits of $300,000 combined single limit per claim.

in the performance of professional services under this agreement. Limits required per the following schedule:

**Contract Amount** | **Minimum Required Limit**
